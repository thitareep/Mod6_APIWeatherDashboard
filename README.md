# Module 6 | Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
## Weather Dashboard
## Description
This is the completed Weather Dashboard application for the Module 6 Server-Side API Weather Dashboard challenge. The purpose for this challenge was to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser. It features HTML and CSS, and uses the Open Weather server-side API. The weather dashboard allows the user to search and view a city's current and 5-day forecast weather conditions. It displays the date, an icon for the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also features a search history where localStorage is used to store persistent data.
